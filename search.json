    "text": "Clustering MLB Starting Pitchers\nFor my Honors Senior Project I clustered MLB starting pitchers from the 2023 season. I used both R and Python to achieve this. By grouping pitchers based on pitch selection, I’m looking to see how pitchers within those groups may change their “style” under different conditions i.e runners in scoring position, different counts, different outs, different types of hitters. I used heatmaps, linear models, hierarchal clustering, ranks and z-scores to visualize the data. The project culminated in a 40-page report where I explained each step of the process. The repository for this can be found Here."

Topics include simple and multiple linear regression, model diagnostics and testing, residual analysis, transformations, indicator variables, variable selection techniques, logistic regression, and analysis of variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro to Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course focused on applying data science and statistical methods using R. Topics included data manipulation and visualization, programming, string manipulation, and modern data sources (such as web and databases). This course taught the building blocks of larger scale data science projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course used strategies in Java to organize, process, and retrieve data. Topics included arrays, lists, stacks, queues, maps, trees, and algorithm analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nAn upper level statistics class focused on visualizing data using R. Topics include mapping data, linear regression, logistic regression, interactivity, and building a shiny app. The course includes an introduction to computer analysis of data with a statistical computing package. There was a heavy focus on ethically communicating and presenting data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nAn upper level computer science class focused on using SQL and Python. A look at how data is logically organized, physically stored on a digital device, and queried. Focuses primarily on relational database systems and structured queries. Other topics include non-relational data models, privacy, security, performance, and reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nAn upper level statistics class. Statistical methods for analyzing data that vary over time are investigated. Topics may include forecasting systems, regression methods, moving averages, exponential smoothing, seasonal data, analysis of residuals, prediction intervals and Box-Jenkins models. Application to real data, particularly economic data, is emphasized along with the mathematical theory underlying the various models and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical and Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduces techniques for developing advanced models from datasets, for the purposes of better understanding the data and making predictions about future data. Techniques include linear and regularized regression, nearest neighbor classification, support vector machines, decision tree ensembles, and neural networks. Examines real-world applications, both successes and failures, the latter of which often involve data with embedded biases. Students will develop both technical and ethical competence in using some of the most powerful computational tools in data science."

In addition, I worked on a game camera images uploader in Java.\nI worked on developing modules for the SCORE Network with Dr. Ivan Ramler and Dr. Robin Lock.
