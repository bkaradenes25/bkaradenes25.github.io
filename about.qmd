At St. Lawrence University, I worked on various projects focused on visualizing data and statistics education.

For my Data Visualization final project I created a shiny app in R displaying MLB playoff spray charts for hitters.

As a computer science intern for Nature Up North I developed a python script to sort game camera images. In addition, I worked on a game camera images uploader in Java.

I worked on developing modules for the [SCORE Network](https://data.scorenetwork.org/){target="_blank"} with Dr. Ivan Ramler and Dr. Robin Lock. The modules include statistics and data science education materials for underrepresented sports including professional woman's hockey, olympic swimming, UFC, and more.

For my senior year honors project I used cluster analysis to find pitch selection insights in Python and R working with MLB data with Dr. Ramler.

In my Database Systems class I worked with two classmates on creating and writing queries for a book ratings database with over a million entries.

More info about these projects can be found in the "Projects" tab.
