Topics include simple and multiple linear regression, model diagnostics and testing, residual analysis, transformations, indicator variables, variable selection techniques, logistic regression, and analysis of variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro to Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course focused on applying data science and statistical methods using R. Topics included data manipulation and visualization, programming, string manipulation, and modern data sources (such as web and databases). This course taught the building blocks of larger scale data science projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course used strategies in Java to organize, process, and retrieve data. Topics included arrays, lists, stacks, queues, maps, trees, and algorithm analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nAn upper level statistics class focused on visualizing data using R. Topics include mapping data, linear regression, logistic regression, interactivity, and building a shiny app. The course includes an introduction to computer analysis of data with a statistical computing package. There was a heavy focus on ethically communicating and presenting data."
